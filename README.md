UndeterministicStateMachine
===========================


Data combinator for creating an undeterministic parametric state machine, suitible to compose complex state-oriented computations.

As an example of such "complex state-oriented" computation could be producing an AST from a stream of tokens, functional 
reactive programming or comunication protocols.

In this repository it is also included, as an example, how to use it for parsing a film-subtitle file. 
(actually, this small example was used once for fixing a real problem I had once when wahtching a movie...)
