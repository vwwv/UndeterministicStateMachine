UndeterministicStateMachine
===========================


Data combinator for creating an undeterministic parametric state machine, suitible to compose lexers with complex tokens.


In this repository it is also included, as an example, how to use it for parsing a film-subtitle (*.srt) file. 
(actually, this small example was used once for fixing a real problem I had once when wahtching a that german movie...)
