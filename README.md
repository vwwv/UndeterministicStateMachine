UndeterministicStateMachine
===========================


Data combinator for creating an undeterministic parametric state machine, suitible to compose complex state-oriented computations.

As an example of such "complex state-oriented" computation could be producing an AST from a stream of token, functional 
reactive programming or comunication protocols.

In this repository it is also include as an example how to use it for parsing a subtitle file in order to modify it 
(actually, this example was used  for fixing a real problem I had once...)
